# 🌐 Basic Informational Website

This project was created as part of a personal exercise to reinforce my understanding of core HTML concepts and to build a simple static site with navigation and a custom 404 error page. The site contains four pages and demonstrates clean structure and basic client-side routing through internal links.

The application provides the following pages:

- **Home (`index.html`)** – a welcome page with navigation to the other sections.  
- **About (`about.html`)** – a short description of the purpose behind the site.  
- **Contact Me (`contact-me.html`)** – a basic contact section with a placeholder email.  
- **404 (`404.html`)** – a custom error page for invalid routes.
